# anky_radio

- only holders of the anky genesis nft can add music to the database.
- every time a piece is added, it goes to the system with a state: future.
- the radio is an eternal thread of music, sending it from the future to the present.
- one at a time.
- if there are no more pieces in the future, all of the ones that are on the past are sent to the future.
- and it starts again.
- over and over again.
- fully onchain.
- full groove.
